### The Solution
The solution for the previous app :
- Use clearly route navigation like packages [AutoRoute](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)
- the error is not in the geolocation, but the navigation application error, and its not clear
- I dont have the core source code the previous apps, so I cant comment much;

The trouble form my app :
- not yet complete , code from scratch , late cause does not have a code with the same design
- menu current location , for autocomplete input location , need google place api 
- menu current location , for auto get location , not yet implemented (use a packages geolocator & geocoding)
