### The Solution
The solution for the previous app :
- Use clearly route navigation like packages [AutoRoute](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)
- the error is not in the geolocation, but the navigation application error, and its not clear
- I dont have the core source code the previous apps, so I cant comment much;

The trouble from my app :
- the packages flutter_screenutil not complete yet implement adapting screen
- best only screen resolution is 1280x720
- late because dont have a code with the same design
- the current location menus , for manual input , the autocomplete input location , need google place api
